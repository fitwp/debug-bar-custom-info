This plugin adds an extra panel to Debug Bar plugin that allows developers to output custom debug info.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an extra panel to [Debug Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar/) plugin that allows developers to output custom debug info.

Developers can log any variable to see its value when running PHP in WordPress. This helps developers see the real-time values of variables. It works exactly like `console.log()` in browsers.

= How to add custom debug info =

Add the following code wherever you want to debug a variable:

`do_action( 'add_debug_info', $var );`

where `$var` can has any data type.

- If `$var` is a string or any simple value, the value is outputted directly.
- If `$var` is an array or object, the output is the same as `print_r( $var )`.

= How to view debug info =

- Click on **Debug Bar** in the top right of the admin bar
- Select **Custom Info** panel (see [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/debug-bar-custom-info/screenshots/))
